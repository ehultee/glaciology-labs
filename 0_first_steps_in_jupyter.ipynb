    "Welcome to this introduction to [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)! Notebooks are interactive documents that originated from the Python programming language, but have since spread to other languages (previously called \"iPython notebook\", you'll often find it by this name on forums or websites). The advantage of Jupyter notebooks is that they can include explanatory text, code, and graphics in the same document.\n",
